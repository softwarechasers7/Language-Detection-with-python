Language Detection with Machine Learning 
As a human, you can easily detect the languages you know. For example, I can easily identify Hindi and English, but being an Pakistani, it is also not possible for me to identify all Pakistani languages. This is where the language identification task can be used. Google Translate is one of the most popular language translators in the world which is used by so many people around the world. It also includes a machine learning model to detect languages that you can use if you donâ€™t know which language you want to translate.
The most important part of training a language detection model is data. The more data you have about every language, the more accurate your model will perform in real-time. The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages, so it will be an appropriate dataset for training a language detection model with machine learning. So in the section below, I will take you through how you can train a language detection model with machine learning using Python.
